# Roadmap

- Automatically remove Nodes on Netbox when removed on Proxmox (as it already happens with Virtual Machines and Containers)- Add **'Console'** button to enable console access to virtual machines
- Background Jobs to sync data between the systems
- Add periodic update of the whole environment so that the user does not need to manually click the update button.
- Improve Documentation
